# Getting Started

Demo Site: http://word-web-app.s3-website.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/

### Back-end

Back-end must be running for front-end to work properly.

```
git clone https://github.com/fjlanasa/word-web-app-back-end.git
cd word-web-app-backend
bundle install
ruby server.rb
```

### Front-end

Make sure you have [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (npm) installed.

Once npm is set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/fjlanasa/word-web-app-front-end.git
cd word-web-app-front-end
npm install

npm start

open http://localhost:3000

```

### Questions:
1. State

2. How long?

3. I tend to gravitate more towards online classes and tutorials rather than books. Some of the most recent things I've gone through:
  * Udacity's course on [Responsive Web Design](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-web-design-fundamentals--ud893), which helped me dig deeper into some design concepts I started to explore through my breakable toy.

  * Udacity's course on [Front-end Frameworks](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-frameworks--ud894), specifically the lesson on Angular, just to get an idea about the differences between the frameworks and why one might choose one over another.

  * [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/), as I want to try to learn to build apps using another language and framework.

4. Immediately prior to starting this challenge, I was planning to build a simple note-taking app using a Rails API, mainly for practice using Redux, as well as to try implementing Angular. I'm definitely excited to pick that back up now that I've actually gotten my hands dirty with redux.
